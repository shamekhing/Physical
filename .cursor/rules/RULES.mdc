## 1. Data & Code Quality  
- ❌ NO MOCK DATA allowed in production code.  
- ✅ Test data (if required) must only exist in `/tests/data/`.  
- All code must follow the project’s linting and formatting rules.  
- No unused variables, imports, or dead code.  
- Functions/classes must have documented input and output expectations.  

---

## 2. Project Structure & Organization  
- Each feature must exist in its own folder:  

  ```
  /features/<feature-name>/
      README.md
      src/
      tests/
  ```  

- Each feature folder **must include**:  
  - `README.md` (see Section 3).  
  - Source code files.  
  - Unit and integration tests.  

- When moving or renaming files:  
  - All **import paths must be updated**.  
  - A **full build must pass** before committing.  

---

## 3. Documentation Requirements  
### Feature README.md Template  

```md
# <Feature Name>  

## Description  
<Brief explanation of the feature>  

## Usage Notes  
<Setup or runtime instructions>  

## Test List  

| # | Test Name      | Description                        |  
|---|----------------|------------------------------------|  
| 1 | ExampleTest    | Verifies example functionality     |  
| 2 | APIResponse    | Ensures correct data from endpoint |  

## Limitations / Assumptions  
- <List constraints if any>  
```

- Each feature `README.md` must contain a **test list table**.  
- The root `README.md` must describe:  
  - Project overview.  
  - Folder structure.  
  - Contribution guidelines.  

---

## 4. Testing Standards  
- Tests must run until **all pass** (manual termination not allowed).  
- Each feature must include:  
  - **Unit tests** (module-level).  
  - **Integration tests** (system-level).  
- Minimum test coverage: **≥ 80%**.  
- Test data must be reproducible (random seeds fixed).  

---

## 5. Validation & CI/CD  
- **Pre-commit**: run linting, formatting, type checks.  
- **Pre-push**: run full test suite.  
- **CI/CD Rules**:  
  - PRs must pass all builds & tests.  
  - No feature is merged without updated README and test list.
